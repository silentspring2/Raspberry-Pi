## Raspberry-Pi

We developed a smart home mini-system based on Raspberry Pi and Wechat public account. All codes are run on a Raspberry Pi server, and the user can easily access the services through a Wechat public account. This mini-system incorporates some simple functions, such as answering inquiries about whether conditions or recent news. It also includes some advanced services, including face detection, speaker recognition and even a reinforcement learning based Gobang game AI.
